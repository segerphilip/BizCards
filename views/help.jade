  h3 Design Guidelines
  ul
    li Make sure that text or other finer details are not touching the edge of the card design
    li Try to make your final design as close to the business card aspect ratio (3.5:2) as possible
    li Areas you want to be etched/marked can be any color except white or other very light colors
    li Areas you want to be cut all the way through should be outlined in red (hex value #FF0000) and 0.01pt thickness
    li Note: The final card can have holes, light un-etched areas, and dark etched areas. The laser cutter cannot add color to the card.
